<h4> A sophomore at Washington University in St. Louis, I grew up in Menlo Park and attended Castilleja School in Palo Alto, essentially being fed “design thinking” and the importance of innovation as my bread and butter. Yet throughout my life I have always had combined interests in both the arts and the social sciences and have eagerly searched for careers that fuse the two.
  <br><br>
This semester I took a class called Advertising in the Digital Age and one of its lessons was centered on strategic planning, branding and the art of connecting the consumer and company to improve its products and experiences. After that class I knew I had found the path that fit my strengths and interests and I realized my past activities were extremely applicable to the field of branding, strategic planning and public relations.
<br><br>
Throughout high school I explored different techniques of image and artistic branding including taking street fashion and textile design classes at Central Saint Martins in London, fashion styling at Academy of Art in San Francisco, and founding the Castilleja Gallery Leadership Club which works to inspire student initiated installments and involvement in our campus’ gallery.
<br><br>
In Summer 2013 I conducted research at Stanford under the guidance of Dr. Sarah Soule and today I am an editor of WashU’s fashion magazine, Armour, whose burgeoning identity we are refining every day.
<br><br>
At WashU I am merging a major in American Culture Studies including a concentration in Visual, Digital and Material Cultures with a minor in Communication Design from the Sam Fox School of Design. I believe that this combination provides a solid foundation for a dynamic career as it combines visual, creative skills with the strategic, ethnographic research of discovering consumers’ needs and desires. </h4>
